## 1.2.0 (2019-04-29)

### Added

- Pagination has had a massive overhaul. Docs have been updated. Please file issues
  should you run into any problems. You may wish to review
  [the pull request](https://github.com/jeregrine/jsonapi/pull/189) for more details.
- [More typespecs](https://github.com/jeregrine/jsonapi/pull/198)
- `EnsureSpec` Plug now sets the JSON:API response content type
  [for you](https://github.com/jeregrine/jsonapi/pull/185). This means you need
  not manually include the `ResponseContentType` Plug in your pipeline should you
  already have `EnsureSpec` in play. Please see the documentation for
  `ResponseContentType` should you wish to override it for a specific end-point.

### Changed

- Ex Doc was updated to leverage some of its fancy new features.
- `EnsureSpec` pipeline checks to ensure that
  [a PATCH request has an ID](https://github.com/jeregrine/jsonapi/commit/86d98d9dc0ddd29143b9da1a6522acfbcb8bb904)
- Documentation improvements
